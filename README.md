# Gender Sorting and Occupational Tasks Across Countries

## Project Description

This project investigates **how men and women sort into different types of occupations** defined by task content:

- **Abstract**
- **Routine**
- **Manual**

We focus specifically on two mechanisms:

1. **Overwork Sorting**  
   How do long-hour work environments affect the gender composition of high-skill jobs?

2. **Baseline Ability Sorting**  
   How do measures of baseline skills (numeracy, literacy, problem-solving) predict women's occupational outcomes compared to men's?

Our analysis leverages survey data that includes:

- Occupational codes
- Skill assessments
- Work hours and job characteristics
- Demographics

2. Open Stata, change the path, then run:
   - `0_Master.do`    
  This will run all of the code for the project.
